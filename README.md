# IDF2PH
IDF2PH (www.idf2ph.com) is a free open source toolkit for converting the US Dept of Energy's EnergyPlus (E+) files into PHPP energy models for PHI Passive House certification and design evaluation.

The IDF2PH plugins for Rhino and Grasshopper work alongside the Ladybug/Honeybee (https://www.ladybug.tools/) grasshopper plugins and will allow you to build and manage a complete Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) model from within Grasshopper. It will also allow you to export EnergyPlus .IDF files into a PHPP document. 

Disclaimer: Before you continue note that these tools in no way replace the PHPP or Honeybee, nor are they affiliated with the Ladybug Tools team or Passive House Institute in any way. These tools are created independently and are simply provided here for use by those who are interested. These tools are in an early, early stage of development: do not use them on important files or projects. We're not responsible for anything that breaks as a result. Use at your own risk.
